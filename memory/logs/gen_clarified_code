Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation. Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies (overpopulation). Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell (reproduction). To implement these rules, the Model would likely need a method that iterates over each cell in the grid, calculates the number of live neighbors, and applies the above rules to determine whether each cell should be alive or dead in the next generation.
