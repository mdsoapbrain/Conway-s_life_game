Each cell in the grid could be represented by a boolean value, where true represents an alive cell and false represents a dead cell. Updating the game grid would involve applying the rules of Conway's Game of Life to each cell. These rules are: Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies (underpopulation). Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation. Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies (overpopulation). Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell (reproduction). To implement these rules, the Model would likely need a method that iterates over each cell in the grid, calculates the number of live neighbors, and applies the above rules to determine whether each cell should be alive or dead in the next generation. After checking all cells, the Model should replace the current grid stat with new one\n\nIs anything else unclear?
