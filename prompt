I can build a web version of Conway's Game of Life using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Specifically, here's what the parts might do:

Model: This would be a JavaScript object that holds the state of the game. It should have some sort of 2D array to store the game grid and provide a method to update the grid according to the rules of Conway's Game of Life.

View: This would be a JavaScript object responsible for displaying the state of the game on the webpage. It should have a method that takes the game state from the Model and renders it on the HTML page in an appropriate format.

Controller: This would be a JavaScript object that handles user input and manipulates the Model or View accordingly. For instance, it might have methods to start/stop the game, or modify the initial state of the game grid based on user input.

The actual keyboard controls could be facilitated by HTML buttons and JavaScript event listeners, like so:

"Start/Stop" button: Clicking this button would start or pause the execution of the game.
"Step" button: Clicking this button would advance to the next generation when the game is paused.
Grid cells: Clicking a cell would toggle its alive/dead state.
As for the HTML and CSS, I would likely want an HTML table to represent the game grid, with each cell represented by a table data cell (<td>). I could use CSS to style the table and cells, as well as any other game control elements.
